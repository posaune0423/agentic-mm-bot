      "There were zero fills and no cancels, indicating the spread may be too wide, or the quoting frequency too low for current market conditions.",
      "Reducing 'baseHalfSpreadBps' from 10 to 9 (10% change) to slightly narrow the spread, thus potentially increasing fills.",
      "Reducing 'refreshIntervalMs' from 1000 to 900 can increase quote updates, helping to capture more trading opportunities in case the market moves slightly during idle times.",
      "No negative markout data available, so adjustments should focus primarily on enhancing activity without impacted fill quality."
