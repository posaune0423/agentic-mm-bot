      "No fills indicate the spread might be too wide. Reducing 'baseHalfSpreadBps' by 10% (from 10 to 9) could attract more orders by offering tighter quotes.",
      "Decreasing 'refreshIntervalMs' from 1000ms to 900ms allows quotes to update more frequently, potentially capturing advantageous price movements more effectively and attracting more fills.",
      "If these tweaks result in increased activity without negative markout, it suggests improved engagement without increased exposure to toxic flow.",
      "Rollback if there's no improvement in fill activity or if the decrease in spread leads to negative markout."
