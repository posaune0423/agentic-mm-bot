      "Decreasing 'refreshIntervalMs' by 10% from 1000 to 900 ms will make the bot more responsive, potentially capturing more favorable market conditions with quicker quote updates.",
      "If the changes do not lead to increased fills or if fills occur with negative markout, rollback conditions will be triggered to revert to safer parameters."
